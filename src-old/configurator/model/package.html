<body>
<p>The idea-configurator model closely mimics the IDEA "iml" file. Most elements
    in the iml file are expressed as a class in the model. Each attribute of an
    element is expressed as an attribute of the corresponding class.
</p>

<p>Each IDEA module type (e.g. Java, Webapp, etc) has a corresponding module
    class in configurator.model.module. Every module is implemented as a
    collection of configurator.model.Component instances.
    Components contain some number of classes implementing
    configurator.model.XmlElement. XmlElement know how to add an XML Element
    to a DOM.
</p>

    Module [1] --> [0..*] Componenet [1] --> [0..*] XmlElement
